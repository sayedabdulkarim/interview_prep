Certainly! Here are some questions that can be tackled using the Frequency Counter pattern:

### 1. Check Anagrams
Write a function to check if two strings are anagrams of each other. An anagram is a word or phrase formed by rearranging the letters of another word.

### 2. Find Duplicates in an Array
Write a function that takes an array of integers and returns an array of all duplicate integers.

### 3. Count Unique Values in Sorted Array
Write a function that counts the unique values in a sorted array.

### 4. Sum of Zero
Write a function that takes an array of integers and finds two distinct elements that sum to zero.

### 5. Valid Sequence
Write a function to determine if an array can be formed by a subsequence of another array, without changing the order of elements.

### 6. Same Frequency
Write a function that takes two positive integers and returns true if the two numbers have the same frequency of digits.

### 7. Check if N and its Double Exist
Write a function that checks if there exists two integers N and M such that N is the double of M in an array.

### 8. Ransom Note
Write a function to check if a ransom note can be constructed from a magazine; that is, if the words in the ransom note are all present in the magazine.

### 9. Find all Anagrams in a String
Write a function that finds all the start indices of the anagrams of a word in a text.

### 10. Group Anagrams
Write a function that takes an array of strings and groups anagrams together.


////HARD
For example, a more advanced problem might ask you to:

Find the Longest Subarray With a Given Sum: Write a function that finds the longest contiguous subarray in an array that adds up to a given sum.

Least Recently Used Cache (LRU Cache): Implement an LRU Cache with a specific size limit. When the cache reaches its limit, the least recently used item should be removed.

Longest Substring Without Repeating Characters: Write a function to find the length of the longest substring without repeating characters.

Sliding Window Maximum: Given an array of integers and a number 
�
k, find the maximum element for each and every contiguous subarray of size 
�
k.

First Unique Character in a String: Given a string, find the first non-repeating character in it and return its index. If it doesn't exist, return -1.
