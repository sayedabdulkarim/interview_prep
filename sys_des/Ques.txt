### **Beginner Level:**
- Focus on understanding fundamental design concepts.
- Questions are generally simpler and involve straightforward architectures.

#### **Examples:**
1. **Design a URL Shortener** (e.g., Bitly):
   - How to store and retrieve shortened URLs.
   - Discuss basic database schema.
   - Explain how to handle collisions for unique keys.

2. **Design a Chat Application** (e.g., WhatsApp):
   - Discuss real-time communication using WebSockets.
   - Explain how to store and retrieve messages.
   - Discuss user presence (online/offline status).

3. **Design a Library Management System**:
   - How to store books, users, and transactions.
   - Basic features like issuing/returning books.
   - Database design and API requirements.

4. **Design a Rate Limiter**:
   - Implement rate limiting for APIs.
   - Discuss token buckets or leaky buckets concepts.
   - Explain how to handle bursts of traffic.

---

### **Intermediate Level:**
- Focus on scalable architectures, distributed systems, and handling edge cases.
- Questions require deeper knowledge of system components.

#### **Examples:**
1. **Design a News Feed System** (e.g., Facebook/LinkedIn):
   - How to fetch and display posts for a user.
   - Use of caching for frequently accessed data.
   - Sorting, filtering, and ranking mechanisms.

2. **Design a File Storage System** (e.g., Google Drive, Dropbox):
   - Handle large file uploads/downloads.
   - Directory structure and metadata storage.
   - Discuss replication and fault tolerance.

3. **Design a Search Autocomplete System**:
   - How to suggest queries as the user types.
   - Efficient data structures (e.g., Trie).
   - Ranking of suggestions based on user popularity.

4. **Design a Ride-Sharing System** (e.g., Uber):
   - Matching riders with drivers.
   - Handling real-time location updates.
   - Load balancing and fault tolerance.

---

### **Advanced Level:**
- Involves complex systems, distributed systems, and scaling challenges.
- Questions test your ability to think through trade-offs and design for high availability.

#### **Examples:**
1. **Design a Distributed Cache** (e.g., Memcached/Redis):
   - How to handle cache invalidation.
   - Consistency and partitioning strategies.
   - Handling failover and replication.

2. **Design a Video Streaming Platform** (e.g., YouTube, Netflix):
   - Video upload, storage, and encoding.
   - Content delivery using CDNs.
   - Adaptive bitrate streaming and handling millions of users.

3. **Design an E-commerce System** (e.g., Amazon):
   - Handling product catalogs, search, and recommendations.
   - Cart and order management.
   - Handling high traffic during sales (scaling and sharding).

4. **Design a Distributed Database**:
   - Discuss consistency models (e.g., CAP theorem).
   - Partitioning, replication, and sharding.
   - Write and read optimization.

5. **Design a Notification System** (e.g., for Email/SMS/Push Notifications):
   - Prioritization of messages.
   - Ensuring message delivery and retries.
   - Scalability for millions of notifications per second.

### **Key Areas to Prepare for Each Level:**
- **Beginner:** Database design, APIs, basic architecture, and CRUD operations.
- **Intermediate:** Scalability, load balancing, caching, real-time systems, and fault tolerance.
- **Advanced:** Distributed systems, consistency, partitioning, replication, and handling high concurrency.

For **all levels**, be ready to discuss:
1. **Trade-offs:** Why choose one approach over another?
2. **Bottlenecks:** How to identify and resolve them?
3. **Scalability:** How does your design handle growth in users/data?
