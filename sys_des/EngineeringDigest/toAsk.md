# Consistency

Yes, stopping or pausing read operations during critical write operations can be another strategy to ensure strong consistency, especially in a distributed system. This is often termed as "Read-Write Locking." Here's how it works:

Read Lock: Multiple operations can read the data simultaneously but cannot write.
Write Lock: A write operation obtains a lock that prevents any other read or write operations until it releases the lock.
