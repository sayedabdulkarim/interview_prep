Important list of questions to prepare for JavaScript interviews.

🔍 What is event delegation, and how does it function in JavaScript?
    
    - In JS Event delegation is a technique in JavaScript for handling events efficiently by taking advantage of the event bubbling mechanism. Instead of assigning event listeners directly to individual elements, you attach a single event listener to a common parent of those elements. Then, when the event occurs on any of the child elements, the event bubbles up to the parent, where it's handled.
    
    - In React implements its own event system called the synthetic event system. When you attach an event handler in a React component, you're actually attaching it to a virtual representation of the DOM element, not the real DOM element itself. React wraps native browser events into instances of synthetic events to ensure events have consistent properties and behaviors across different browsers.

🔍 Explain the concept of prototypal inheritance.

🔍 Differentiate between a variable that is null, undefined, or undeclared.

🔍 Define what a closure is and describe its uses and advantages.

🔍 Explain the primary distinction between the Array.forEach() loop and Array.map() method, as well as when to choose one over the other.

🔍 What is a common scenario for employing anonymous functions?

🔍 Distinguish between host objects and native objects.

🔍 Clarify the distinctions among 'function User(){}', 'var user = User()', and 'var user = new User()

🔍 Can you elucidate the purposes of Function.call and Function.apply, along with their notable differences?

🔍 Describe the Function.prototype.bind method.

    function greet() {
        console.log("Hello, " + this.name);
    }

    let person = {name: "Alice"};
    let boundGreet = greet.bind(person);

    boundGreet();  // Output: "Hello, Alice"


🔍 Explain the differences between feature detection, feature inference, and utilizing the User Agent (UA) string.

    1. Feature Detection:
        What it is: Feature detection involves checking directly whether a specific feature or method is supported in the browser/runtime environment.

        if ('querySelector' in document) {
            document.querySelector("#id");
        } else {
            document.getElementById("id");
        }

    2. Feature Inference:
        What it is: Feature inference is about making an assumption that if one feature exists, another related feature probably exists too.    

        if (document.querySelector) {
            // If querySelector exists, then probably querySelectorAll also exists
            var elements = document.querySelectorAll(".class");
        }

    3 - 3. Using the User Agent (UA) String:
        What it is: The User Agent string is a text identifier sent with the HTTP headers that provides information about the browser, its version, and the operating system.

        if (navigator.userAgent.indexOf("MSIE") !== -1) {
            // Code specific to Internet Explorer
        }


🔍 Define the concept of "hoisting."
    - Its a way of moving variables and function to the top of the scope, so the compiler can understand properly like they belong.
    But ther is a caveat like the hoisting behaves differently for var, let n const.
    So if we r using var, it moves to the top and before ny code executes, it will assign the value as undefined.
    But in the case of let n const , they will hoist to the top but they will wait for reinitialozation or redifing.
    So this waiting phase we clled as temporal dead zone.
    So because of this , if we r trying to get the values or result of var before initializing we get an undefined, but in let and const 
    we get a reference error .

🔍 What is type coercion, and what are some common pitfalls associated with relying on it in JavaScript code?

🔍 Give an example of generating a string using ES6 Template Literals and explain their benefits.

🔍 Provide an example of a curry function and clarify why this syntax can be advantageous.

        function currying(...args) {
            const add = (...newArgs) => {
                if (newArgs.length === 0) {
                    return args.reduce((a, b) => a + b, 0);
                } else {
                    return currying(...args, ...newArgs);
                }
            };

            return add;
        }

        const result = currying(4)(5)(6)(7)();
        console.log(result); // Output: 22


🔍 Discuss the benefits of using spread syntax and differentiate it from rest syntax.
    - Spread ( cloning )
        const originalArray = [1, 2, 3];
        const copyArray = [...originalArray];

    - Rest

        //Collecting Remaining Arguments: 
        - function sum(...args) {
            return args.reduce((total, num) => total + num, 0);
          }

        //Collecting Remaining Array Elements: 
        - const [first, second, ...rest] = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];

🔍 Define request lifecycle of a web server ??

    Certainly! Here's a simplified ASCII diagram illustrating the basic request lifecycle of a web server:

```
Client (e.g., Web Browser)              Web Server (e.g., Node.js, Apache, Nginx)

  |              HTTP Request               |
  | --------------------------------------> |
  |                                          |
  |          Routing and Middleware          |
  | --------------------------------------> |
  |                                          |
  |        Request Handling (Controller)     |
  | --------------------------------------> |
  |                                          |
  |           Response Generation            |
  | <-------------------------------------- |
  |                                          |
  |          Sending HTTP Response           |
  | <-------------------------------------- |
  |                                          |
  |        Client Processing (Browser)       |
  |                                          |
  |               Request Lifecycle Complete |
  |                                          |
```

Explanation:

- The process begins when the client (e.g., a web browser) sends an HTTP request to the web server.

- The web server's routing system determines how to handle the request, including which part of the application should process it. Middleware functions may also run at this stage.

- The main request handler, often referred to as a controller in web frameworks, processes the request. This step may involve accessing databases, executing business logic, or performing other tasks to generate a response.

- The server generates an HTTP response, which includes the requested content, status codes, headers, and any necessary data. This response can be in various formats (e.g., HTML, JSON).

- The server sends the response back to the client over the network.

- The client (web browser) receives the response and processes it, rendering HTML content, executing JavaScript, and handling additional resources.

- The request lifecycle is considered complete when the client has fully processed the response. Depending on the client's behavior, additional actions may follow, such as user interactions or making subsequent requests.

This diagram provides a high-level overview of the request lifecycle, illustrating the flow of data and interactions between the client and the web server during the request and response process.



🔍 How JavaScript Works - ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VaBP6_pBOgM&t=41s&ab_channel=ThapaTechnical )

     - js 
            => parser ( checkig everylines, and if ny issue, stop there and throws the error, otherwise  if everything goes well move to AST ) 
                => AST ( Abstract Syntax Tree )
                    => Conversion to machine code 
                        => code runs
